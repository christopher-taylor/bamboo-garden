/* FOR FUTURE DEVELOPERS
// All content on the page is being generated by handlebars templates. In order
// to add or change menu items, look here. The HTML files only need to be 
// changed in order to alter the layout. I used sass, so for an easy time with 
// my CSS look at styles.scss instead of .css. The JSON is laid out according 
// to the following rules.
// 1. The main Array, containing an object for each category
// 2. Categories support the following attributes: categoryName, Description, 
//    Hanzi, and a Food array
// 3. Food items support the following attributes: number, hanzi, name, 
//    description, and booleans for the following: isHeartHealthy, isVegan,
//    isSpicy, as well as an array of objects that can contain an object for
//    each price and a label for that price.
// 4. For both categories and food items, the following items may be omitted: 
//    hanzi, description, price labels, isHeartHealthy, isVegan, isSpicy
